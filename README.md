"# Note-App" 
Initialization and DOM Selection

The code starts by selecting key DOM elements:
notesContainer: Represents the container for displaying notes.
createBtn: Corresponds to the "Create Notes" button.
notes: A collection of existing notes in the .input-box class.
Display Existing Notes (showNotes Function)

The showNotes function retrieves stored notes from the browser's local storage and displays them within the notesContainer. This ensures that users can see their existing notes even after the page is refreshed.
Update Local Storage (updateStorage Function)

The updateStorage function is responsible for saving the current content of the notesContainer into the browser's local storage. It is called whenever changes are made to the notes, ensuring that the data is consistently saved.
Create New Notes

An event listener is attached to the "Create Notes" button (createBtn).
When this button is clicked, it triggers the creation of a new note:
A <p> element (paragraph) is dynamically generated, which represents the note's content.
An <img> element is also created, representing a delete icon.
The new note is appended to the notesContainer to make it visible to the user.
Edit and Delete Notes

An event listener on the notesContainer listens for user interactions with existing notes.
If a user clicks on the delete icon (<img>), the corresponding note is deleted from the container.
If a user clicks on a note (<p>), the note becomes editable, allowing users to modify its content. Any changes made are automatically saved to the local storage.
Handling Enter Key (Creating Line Breaks)

A global event listener attached to the document detects when the "Enter" key is pressed.
When the "Enter" key is detected, it inserts a line break within the currently edited note. This prevents the default behavior of creating a new paragraph when the "Enter" key is pressed.
In summary, this code creates a basic note-taking web application that allows users to create, edit, and delete notes. The notes are stored in the browser's local storage for persistent access, even after page refreshes. The code is structured to handle user interactions, including creating, editing, and deleting notes, as well as ensuring that changes are saved consistently.
